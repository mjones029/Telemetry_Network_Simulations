# Telemetry_Network_Simulations
Code and data for simulating impact of telemetry sampling on contact network estimation.

## Workflow order:
## 1. Random_Start_Simulations.R

Movement simulations are generated in random, lattice, or clustered spatial configurations.

"Random_Start_Simulations.R" shows full code for generating movement trajectories, detecting contacts, and "telemetry" sampling from trajectories.

"Lattice_Start_Simulations.R" and "Cluster_Start_Simulations.R" just show how the movement trajectories are generated for these spatial configurations.

The Random_Start_Simulations.R script makes use of several additional functions. These are:

a. w.circ.mean.R

b. BCRW_sim.R

c. distance.R

d. simul.contacts.R

e. sample.traj_df.R

f. detect.contacts_list.R

g. kernel.udoi.R

h. sample_and_contact.R



## 2. Calculate_SNA_Metrics.R

This script calculates the social network analysis metrics used to compare complete and sample contact networks.


## 3. Analysis_of_SNA.R

This script analyzes the metrics generated by the previous script. In particular, it calculates the ranked correlation coefficient between complete and sample networks for node level metrics. 

## Other files:

"Number of Clusters.Rdata" and "Cluster Start NegBin Sizes.Rdata" are used for generating cluster configured movement trajectories.

The starting locations files are used to generate lattice and cluster configured movement trajectories. These are included for reproducibility, and are based on average home range size for a given movement model parameterization.

The "H15", "H34", "H60", "SAC1", "SAC3", and "SAC4" notations indicate different movement model parameter sets (small home ranges, medium home ranges, large home ranges, small home ranges II, small home ranges III, and small home ranges IV, respectively). Additional details on parameter sets will be available in published manuscript (under review as of 9/6/19) or by request. 

## Other notes:

File naming system has been removed from all scripts. To insert personal file naming system, search any given R file for "insert naming structure" to identify locations where a file name is needed.
